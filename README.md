# prog8targets
Various custom targets for Prog8.

- F256 [Foenix F256](https://c256foenix.com/) 6502/65816 retro computer. Now [available](https://github.com/irmen/prog8/blob/master/examples/customtarget/targetconfigs/f256.properties) available in the main [Prog8](https://github.com/irmen/) repository.
- rp6502 [Picocomputer 6502](https://picocomputer.github.io/)
- SXB6 [WDC W65C816SXB SBC](https://wdc65xx.com/Single-Board-Computers/w65c816sxb/)


## Foenix F256

This target is preliminary with mostly textio support. It requires the microkernel and can be launched from SuperBasic, DOS, File Manager, etc.

Works:

 - Most textio output (no scroll_down/scroll_left/scroll_right)
 - Reading keyboard events (txt.waitkeys, GETIN, CHRIN, etc)

Not working:

 - Disk or file I/O
 - Graphics
 - Sprites
 - Sound
 - Memory banking (via MMU)
 - Networking
 - [everything else]

### Building / Running for F256

Use the `Makefile` (by running `make`) if you can and it will generate `build/hello_f256.pgz` which you need to move to your F256.

To build manually you just need to specify the custom target file:
```
prog8c -target f256.properties -out build/ -asmlist src/hello_f256.p8
```

Once you move `hello_f256.pgz` to your F256 (you might want to just call it hello.pgz) you run it from SuperBasic with `/- hello_f256.pgz` or just `/- hello_f256` or `/- hello` if you called it `hello.pgz`

## Picocomputer 6502

The Picocomputer 6502 (aka rp6502) has very preliminary support.  Currently just `cbm.CHROUT` based functionality (various txt.print calls) for output and `cbm.GETIN` for reading characters from the keyboard.

Works:

 - Minimal textio output.  Most `txt.print` that doesn't use color or fancy codes.
 - Reading keyboard events (txt.waitkeys, GETIN, CHRIN, etc)

Not working:

 - Everything else

### Building / Running for rp6502

Use the `Makefile` (by running `make`) if you can and it will generate `build/hello.rp6502` which you need to move to your Picocomputer via USB flash drive or over the USB serial.

To build manually you just need to specify the custom target file for `prog8c` but then you need to use `tools/rp6502.py` to convert the compiled `.bin` file to a `.rp6502` file.

```
prog8c -target rp6502.properties -out build/ -asmlist src/hello_rp6502.p8
tools/rp6502.py create -o build/hello.rp6502 -a 0x0200 -r 0x0200 build/hello_rp6502.bin
```

You can then copy the `hello.rp6502` to a USB flash drive and insert it in your Picocomputer.  From the `]` prompt use `load hello.rp6502` to launch it.

The `tools/rp6502.py` script can upload the file to the rp6502 file-system or just run it directly. `tools/rp6502.py -c .rp6502 run build/hello.rp6502`

Note that the `rp6502.py` script may reset the rp6502 back to the `]` prompt when it closes the serial interface.  You may need to connect to the serial port and type `reset` or do that via the keyboard attached to the rp6502.

## WDC W65C816SXB

### Building / Running for W65C816SXB
Use the `Makefile` (by running `make`) if you can and it will generate `build/hello_sxb6.bin` which you need to upload to your W65C816SXB via
the USB "TIDE" port and the `tools/sxb6` script.

To build manually you just need to specify the custom target file for `prog8c` to build the binary.

```
prog8c -target w65c816sxb.properties -out build/ -asmlist src/hello_sxb6.p8
```

You can then write ("upload") the file to ram on the W65C816SXB and run it using the `tools/sxb6` script. Check my [sxb repository](https://github.com/gillham/sxb) for more information about the script.

```
tools/sxb6 -d /dev/tty.usbserial-3 write 0x0200 build/hello_sxb6.bin
tools/sxb6 -d /dev/tty.usbserial-3 exec 0x0200
screen -L /dev/tty.usbserial-3 57600
```
